# Dynamic Rego Policy for GCP Terraform Resources

This repository provides tools and scripts to dynamically generate Rego policies for TFLint that enforce label requirements on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources defined in Terraform configurations. The scripts categorize GCP resources based on their support for labels and generate corresponding Rego policies to validate label adherence.

- `.tflint.d/policies/`: Directory where TFLint policy files are stored.
    - `resources.rego`: Contains dynamically generated Rego policies based on the Terraform configuration.
    - `tags.rego`: Defines policies for mandatory labels and handling unlabeled resources.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing the Python script (`generate.py`) used to generate the `resources.rego` file.
- `.tflint.hcl`: Configuration file for TFLint.

## What is TFLint and Why is it Used?

[TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) is a powerful linting tool designed for Terraform configurations. It checks Terraform code for potential issues, enforces best practices, and ensures that configurations are optimized for the cloud provider in use.

### Why TFLint is Important:

1. **Error Prevention**: Catches errors early, such as deprecated syntax, missing required fields, or improper resource configurations.
2. **Best Practices**: Enforces best practices for each cloud provider to avoid misconfigurations and unnecessary complexity.
3. **Policy Enforcement**: With its plugin architecture, TFLint allows custom policies using OPA Rego, enabling users to enforce specific organizational policies.

### Why Use TFLint for GCP?

AWS and Azure have built-in TFLint rulesets that check for missing tags and enforce tagging policies by default. However, GCP lacks built-in rules for enforcing label requirements in Terraform configurations, leaving GCP resources often unlabelled, which complicates billing, tracking, and compliance.

To address this gap, this repository provides custom policies using OPA Rego to ensure:

- **Custom Validation**: Mandatory labels such as `Environment` and `Owner` are enforced on all GCP resources that support labels.
- **Flexibility**: Dynamically generated policies can be adjusted based on your specific Terraform configurations and requirements.

## TFLint OPA Rego Policies

### What is TFLint OPA Ruleset?

[TFLint OPA Ruleset](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-opa) is a plugin that allows integration of [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) Rego policies into TFLint. With this plugin, users can write custom validation rules using Rego, and TFLint will apply them during the Terraform code analysis.

#### Key Features:
- **Rego Policy Integration**: Allows writing custom rules for resource validation using Rego language.
- **Flexibility**: Supports enforcement of custom policies, such as security best practices, label validation, and resource-specific requirements.
- **Compatibility**: Can be used for any Terraform provider, including AWS, Azure, and GCP, by writing rules specific to that provider.

The OPA plugin extends the default capabilities of TFLint, making it possible to add granular control over Terraform configurations based on user-defined rules.

### 🏷️ `tags.rego`

The `tags.rego` file includes Rego policies that enforce label requirements on GCP resources. The policies are:

1. **Mandatory Labels** 🏷️
    - Enforces the presence of the following labels:
        - `Environment` 🌍
        - `Owner` 👤

2. **Supported Resource Types** ✅
    - Applies to resource types that support labels, as defined in the dynamically generated `resources.rego` file.

3. **Rules**
    - **Missing or Empty Labels** ❌
        - **Rule**: Resources must have at least one label.
        - **Issue**: Reports if the `labels` field is missing or empty.
    - **Missing Mandatory Labels** ❌
        - **Rule**: Resources must include all mandatory labels (`Environment`, `Owner`).
        - **Issue**: Reports if any mandatory labels are missing.
    - **Unknown Labels** ❓
        - **Rule**: Dynamic or unknown values are not allowed in labels.
        - **Issue**: Reports if a label contains dynamic or unknown values.

### 🏷️ `resources.rego`

This file is dynamically generated by the script and contains resource types that support labels. It is critical for defining the resource types that TFLint will enforce label rules on.

### Usage

1. **Policy Files** 📜
    - Place the `tags.rego` and dynamically generated `resources.rego` files in the `.tflint.d/policies` directory.

2. **Configuration** ⚙️
    - Ensure that the `resources.rego` file correctly reflects the supported resource types, as this defines where the label policies will apply.

3. **TFLint Configuration** ⚙️
    - The `.tflint.hcl` file should include the following configuration to enable the OPA plugin:

        ```hcl
        plugin "opa" {
            enabled = true
            version = "0.7.0"
            source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-opa"
        }
        ```

4. **Running TFLint** ▶️
    - Validate Terraform configurations with TFLint and the Rego policies:
    
        ```bash
        tflint --config .tflint.hcl --recursive
        ```
    
    - TFLint will read the policies from the `.tflint.d/policies` directory and apply them to your Terraform configurations.

5. **Example** 🌟
    - The policy will ensure GCP resources in Terraform configurations have mandatory labels and do not have unknown or empty labels. Issues will be reported with details.

## Terraform Resource Management Script

This script automates the generation of a dynamic `resources.rego` file based on the current Terraform configuration for GCP resources.

### Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (version 0.13 or later)
- Python 3.x
- Required Python modules: `json`, `subprocess`, `os`, `shutil`, `argparse`

### Usage

1. **Basic Usage** 🚀
    - Ensure Terraform is installed and in your system's PATH.
    - Navigate to the `scripts` directory:
    
        ```bash
        cd scripts
        ```
    
    - Run the script to generate the Rego policy and perform other operations:
    
        ```bash
        python3 generate.py
        ```

    - This will:
        - Clean up existing Terraform files and directories.
        - Create a `provider.tf` file.
        - Initialize Terraform.
        - Fetch the GCP provider schema.
        - Categorize resources based on label support.
        - Generate the `resources.rego` file in the `.tflint.d/policies/` directory.

2. **Generating JSON Files** 📊
    - To generate JSON files for resources with and without labels, use the `--generate-json` flag:

        ```bash
        python3 generate.py --generate-json
        ```

    - This will create:
        - `resources_with_labels.json`: List of GCP resources that support labels.
        - `resources_without_labels.json`: List of GCP resources that do not support labels.

### Script Overview

- `cleanup()`: Removes the `.terraform` directory, `provider.tf` file, and any `.terraform.lock.hcl` files.
- `write_provider_tf()`: Creates a `provider.tf` file with GCP provider configuration.
- `terraform_init()`: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- `get_gcp_provider_schema()`: Fetches the GCP provider schema in JSON format.
- `categorize_resources_by_labels(schema)`: Categorizes GCP resources based on label support.
- `write_json_file(filename, data)`: Writes data to JSON files.
- `write_rego_file(resource_types)`: Generates the `resources.rego` file with a list of resource types that support labels.
- `main()`: Coordinates script execution based on command-line arguments.
